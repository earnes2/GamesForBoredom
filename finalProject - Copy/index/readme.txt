Hello, this is my collection of games. Not much to say, these are pretty
straight-forward. We've got a breakout game, 
an upside-down picture puzzle, and a Choose Your Own Adventure Game!
Technologies used include: HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, & JQuery.

This project has given me an immense appreciation for what 
goes into game design and development - not that I didn't appreciate it before!
I hope you find a small bit of amusement here.
