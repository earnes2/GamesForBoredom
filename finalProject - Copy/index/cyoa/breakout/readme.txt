This breakout game was adapted from a tutorial issued by the Mozilla Developer's Network.
It a twist on the classic arcade-style game that requires you to smash through a series
of obstacles and requires decent hand-eye coordination and timing.
I added an image loop of Jupiter in the background to give the player the feeling that
they are in outerspace and approaching Jupiter's orbit. The obstacles in this case are
an asteroid field. To make the game more challening, I shrank the blocks that comprise
the field, did not add lines on the side of the game interface, and made the ball, or orb,
speed up as you knock out bricks. These varaibles create a much more challenging version 
of the game!
