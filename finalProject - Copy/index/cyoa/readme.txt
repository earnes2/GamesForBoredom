Javascript, HTML5 GAME

This game encompasses my love of choose your own adventure novels and
games. The complexity here could have increased exponentially as there
are endless twists and turns that can be included when you "build it as you go"
as I did here. The story was more stream-of-consciousness to keep it
somewhat random, which is important for building a compelling game. You 
don't want to be too predictable!

My favorite feature is using the Google Maps API as a clue base. The user
needs to move around the map and explore the area before providing input that
will produce a condition of living or dying!
